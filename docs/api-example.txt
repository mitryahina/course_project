In the module API-trial.py realized the vitable API capacities.

At first, NewsApiClient is imported from the newsapi and initialized
by my unique API key.

Sample functions get_headlines(), get_all_articles() and sources() are
creaated to show the basic capacities of newsapi.

get_headlines() function uses top headlines endpoint. It is specified
with parameters q(keyword phrase) and language. At the day of executing
I have found 7 top headlines about bitcoin(default value). Besides that
I received an information about status of request, name and id of source,
author, title, url and date of publishing for each article.

get_all_articles() function returns all articles by the given keyword,
from the given sources and domains between the given dates. It also has
a parameter of language, sorting key and the number of pages to be
returned. I received an information about status of request, name,
description, url and id of source; author, title, url, description
and date of publishing for each article.
