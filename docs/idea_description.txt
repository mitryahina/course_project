                           Your news
In the time of overwhelming amounts of information you will probably
need to move with times and be aware of the most important changes
and events which society faces. But mass media now are often leg behind,
some duplicate or replicate information, others just cannot cover everything
you are interested in. Also, reading a lot of separate news sources is often
tiring and takes too much time.
My suggestion is to create a web-site, which will contain the most top-rated
news only from the reliable sources. The initial version will use News API
(newsapi.org) for extracting articles from over 5,000 large and small news
sources and blogs, which include breaking news as well as lesser articles.
The web-site will have powerful sorting mechanisms to personalize news.
Sorting will be realized according to such keys: country of origin,
category(e.g. business, entertainment, general),sources, keywords or
phrases to look for, language.
In perspective, it is possible to use APIs of social media, such as
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit to include not only 'professional' media
but also news from ordinary users, who are often in the cutting edge.
These posts would be able to search by hash-tags and usernames. Top of events
discussed in social media will also be automatically generated.
