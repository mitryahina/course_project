# course_project


This project is devoted to analyzing whether activity in social media, especially Twitter is 
connected with the news in traditional media.
Using the NewsApi(https://newsapi.org/) and Twitter API through tweepy(http://www.tweepy.org/) I will
get everyday data and then find correlations among it.
